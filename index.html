                For the first time in history, Barack Obama has become the first
                person to ever three-peat in the beatbox world championship. He
                should feel amazing right? - at least that is what most people
                would think. His face though, felt different from the first to
                victories. It was something that most people including reporters
                decoded as a "forced smile".

                Not to anyone's surprise, one year later, Obama has won his
                fourth title. Fans were still happy, cheering for him, but he
                looked like a totally different person now. His face was cold,
                expressionless the whole time. It's like he couldn't even force
                a smile anymore. Telling by his face, the prime minister of the
                National Beatbox Association, completely understood what was
                going on.

            Barack Obama is now a four-time beatbox world champion. Although it
            looked like just the beginning, his face said something else. When
            reporters noticed that, they asked about it, and Barack Obama gave a
            shocking response.

            the same way last year, I just didn't become fully aware of it at
            the time. I won this tournament without beatboxing at all for a
            year. You heard it right. I've lost all my motivation, it doesn't
            bring me joy anymore. Beatboxing is not fair anymore since I'm
            competing. The only one who can beat me, is me."

        This was Barack Obama's last interview. After winning his fourth
        championship, Obama officially retired due to loss of motivation, and
        disappeared from social media. Little did people know, that a few years
        later, he would become the president of The United States.
